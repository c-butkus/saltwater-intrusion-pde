%% Introduction
What is the main theme? Why is it important?
What observations, models, etc are used by others that are different from what you are doing in the project.

%% Equations
What are the fundamental physical/chemical/etc. processes?
Relevant equations and potentially where they come from (i.e. how are they derived)
Describe all terms and parameters. 
Describe any assumptions being made

%% Numerical Methods
Describe the numerical methods used.
Why did you choose to use these methods
Code works as intended

%% Results
What simulations did you run with the model?
Describe the results.
How do the results compare with any known solutions, or data?
How do the results change with different methods, time steps, grid spacing, or model parameters?

%% Figures
At least 4 figures describing results 
Have all axes labeled
Variables have units
Everything is readable
Colors, lines, contours, etc. are all easy to discern

%% Conclusion
What did the model tell you about the process you were studying?
How could the model be improved in terms of methods used or processes included?
